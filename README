PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:

Dump style for output into a NetCDF database. The database format follows the
AMBER NetCDF trajectory convention (http://ambermd.org/netcdf/nctraj.html),
but includes extension to this convention.

Syntax:

dump ID group-ID nc N file args
dump_modify ID keyword values

with

args = list of atom attributes
keyword = double_precision or global
* double_precision: output data as double instead of float
* global = list of global (not per atom, but per frame) quantities
    can be variables, compute or fix data prefixed with v_, c_ and f_,
    respectively.

The list of atom attributes is identical to the 'custom' dump style.

These .nc files can be directly visualized using the libAtoms flavor of
AtomEye (http://www.libatoms.org/). For VMD
(http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) additional topology information
needs to be provided (e.g. a prmtop file).

INSTALLATION:

via a normal LAMMPS package installation: make yes-user-nc

Note that LAMMPS will need to be linked to NetCDF. This will require a
modification of your favorite makefile. Please add

  EXTRA_INC += `nc-config --cflags`
  EXTRA_LIB += `nc-config --libs`

to the respective EXTRA_INC, EXTRA_LIB section of the makefile.
