PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:

This is a LAMMPS (http://lammps.sandia.gov/) dump style for output into a NetCDF
database. The database format follows the AMBER NetCDF trajectory convention
(http://ambermd.org/netcdf/nctraj.html), but includes extensions to this
convention.

NetCDF files can be directly visualized using the libAtoms flavor of
AtomEye (http://www.libatoms.org/), VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
or Ovito (http://www.ovito.org/). Additional topology information may need to be
provided for visualization in VMD (e.g. a prmtop file).

Syntax:

  dump ID group-ID nc N file args
  dump_modify ID keyword values

with

args = list of atom attributes
keyword = double_precision or global
* append yes: append output to existing NetCDF file
* append yes at frame: append out to existing NetCDF file and start writing to
    frame given; if negative frame is counted from the end of file.
* double yes|no: output data as double instead of float
* global = list of global (not per atom, but per frame) quantities
    can be variables, compute or fix data prefixed with v_, c_ and f_,
    respectively.

The list of atom attributes is identical to the 'custom' dump style.

An example would be:

  dump 1 all nc 100 traj.nc type x y z vx vy vz
  dump_modify 1 append yes at -1 global c_thermo_pe c_thermo_temp c_thermo_press

INSTALLATION:

In your LAMMPS src directory type:

  git clone https://github.com/pastewka/lammps-netcdf.git USER-DUMP-NC
  make yes-user-dump-nc

Note that LAMMPS will need to be linked to NetCDF. This will require a
modification of your favorite makefile. Please add

  EXTRA_INC += `nc-config --cflags`
  EXTRA_LIB += `nc-config --libs`

to the respective EXTRA_INC, EXTRA_LIB section of the makefile.

Other notes:

This is package is known to work with LAMMPS 17Dec13.
